# BusCompanyXd

A data structure practice in which Iâ€™m trying to create a custom generic linked list that implements the best of arrays \(enumerability\) and linked lists \(ram efficiency\) for small automation system with basic UIs. The project has a simple program for a bus company that uses the custom list.
